# A mpi program to compute shears

## Usage
First compile
```
make
```
then use ruh.sh
```
sh ./run.sh [number for mpiexec] [number of runs for each epsilonh] [delta] [A]
```
data generated randomly with ```generator.py```

This is only a part from the full project. Recent editions add an input and output function to make the code can run without other parts.
